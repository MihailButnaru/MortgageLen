### What is a Mortgage
A Mortgage is a loan taken out to buy a property or land. Most run for 25 years,
but the term can be shorter or longer. The loan is secured against the
value of your home until it's paid off. If you can't keep up your
repayments the lender can repossess your home and sell it to get their
money back.

### What is amortization
Amortization is the process of spreading out a loan into a series of fixed payments. The loan
is paid off at the end of the payment schedule. Some of each payment goes towards interest costs,
and some goes toward your loan balance. Over time, you pass less in interest and more
toward your balance.
